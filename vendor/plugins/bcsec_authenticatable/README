BcsecAuthenticatable
====================

This is a Devise (https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) strategy for Northwestern's bcsec authentication system.


Installation
============

The strategy and its hooks into the nucore open system are all here in this plugin. The only thing you need to do
is update app/views/sessions/new.html.haml to use a form like this:


- form_for resource_name, resource, :url => session_path(resource_name) do |f|
    %ul.form
      %li
        %label== Username
        = text_field_tag :username, params[:username], :size => 30
      %li
        %label== Password
        = password_field_tag :password, nil, :size => 15
    %ul.horiz
      %li= submit_tag 'Login', :class => 'btn'


In other words, have the form submit parameters 'username' and 'password', not 'user[username]' and 'user[password]'
like Devise's database_authenticatable expects.
