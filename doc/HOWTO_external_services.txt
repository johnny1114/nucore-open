NU Core has an external service framework for integrating with 3rd party applications. For example, the optional surveys
associated with Service products are managed outside of the application, but NU Core links to the surveys and redirects
users to them. NU Core also accepts requests from the survey system in order to store the data it needs to associate
Service orders with the correct survey.

Let's assume you don't want to use the default survey system (Surveyor) and instead use the Super Survey service. You can
introduce Super Survey service as a new external service to NU Core and configure your system to use it. To do so you
would:

1. Create a SuperSurvey model as a subclass of ExternalService. The model should know how to access Super Survey Service.

2. Create a SuperSurveyController. The controller should have (at least) an action to accept requests from the Super Survey service.

3. Override existing survey routes to use SuperSurveyController.

4. Update the external_services.rb initializer to register with the ExternalServiceManager SuperSurvey as the 'survey' service provider.

That's it! Now anywhere surveys are used the SuperSurvey service would be utilized.


In order to make this work NU code should not be concerned with the particular 3rd party services in use. Only the
ExternalServiceManager should be. NU Core code should be concerned with generic service types and ask ExternalServiceManager
about them.

As always, existing code is your best friend! See it for examples.
