        <p>
          You should only update this journal after receiving confirmation of a
          successful or failed journal from NU Financials. If the journal was
          processed successfully without any changes, you may choose "Succeeded,
          no errors". This will mark all orders included in the journal as
          reconciled and you will be unable to make any further changes to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any orders required pricing or payment source changes, or orders
          were removed from the journal in order to succeed, choose "Succeeded,
          with errors". This will mark the journal as successful, but you will
          need to reconcile the orders individually.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the journal failed, you may choose "Failed".
          This will allow you to include all orders in a new journal.
        </p>
